# Web Directory Deletion

This commit marks the deletion of the Flutter web directory.

## Deleted:
- `web/pubspec.yaml`
- `web/lib/` directory and all contents
- `web/build/` directory and all contents  
- `web/web/` directory and all contents

This file will be deleted after confirming the web directory removal is complete.
